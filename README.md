## How to Run

## TODO:
* [] - be able to run standalone scripts
* [] - create tests for the parser, pattern matcher, and parser combinator
* [] - an example of creating an AST from the string of nested functions with arguments
* [] - run tests with ts-node rather than js node (package.json script)
